	I hate to ruin the surprise, but I have a pretty good idea what my parents will be giving me for Christmas. I obtained this top-secret intelligence by placing the order myself.<br /><br />I'm really excited about this year's gift. It's not really one single gift, but a bunch of parts that I'll need to construct the gift. The plan is to build a bona fide arcade cabinet which will house the necessary hardware to provide endless hours of classic gaming enjoyment for all.<br /><br />Hopefully the end result will look something like <a href="http://arcade.home.mindspring.com/sideupdatepic.jpg">this</a>. With Brad's permission, Jamie and I plan on parking this beauty right in our office. This will undoubtedly increase the already high traffic to the Python Pit. Jamie and I are confident in our ability to defeat all challengers at Street Fighter 2.<br /><br />All parts were ordered from <a href="http://www.ultimarc.com">Ulimarc Arcade Controls</a>. Initially the cabinet will provide 2 joysticks with 6 buttons each, along with coin and start buttons for each player. The future holds plans to add a trackball and a spinner control. I plan on documenting the build process in the <a href="/projects/">projects</a> section of MrShoe.org, so check there for updates next month.<br />
