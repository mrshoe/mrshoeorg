	Here at <a href="http://www.polimetrix.com">work</a> we've undertaken a new research project of life-changing consequence. We are boldly going in search of the world's best root beer. We set the baseline at IBC, which was our first sample. Since then we have tried Henry Weinhard's and Root 66. Mike has been given the task of creating a fair and balanced metric along with (of course) an Excel spreadsheet to tabulate our results.<br /><br />I'm sure the ShoeBlog readership is deeply concerned with this matter, so I will post the results periodically.
