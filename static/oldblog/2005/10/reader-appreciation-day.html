	Loyal and Numerous Readers of ShoeBlog,<br /><br />To show my appreciation to those countless hordes who check my blog religiously, I have made a couple of important changes. The way I see it, Blogger members do not have a monopoly on compelling thoughts and provocative opinions. Therefore, I have opened up the comments on ShoeBlog to the world. That's right, you no longer have to log in if you want to add your two cents to the repartee of ShoeBlog. Comment away. As an added bonus, the comment timestamps are now more precise as well.<br /><br />In other news, I have been playing America's Army lately. By lately, of course, I mean pretty much unceasingly for the past four months. The good news is that I'm finally starting to have some success at it. Now I just need to get Eric Hooshmand to play again (he seems distracted now that he's married). Jamie intends on purchasing more random access memory so he can participate in the virtual war on terror as well. Of course I will pwn that sux0r like no other.
