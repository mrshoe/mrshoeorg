	Jamie and I have been working on this phenomenal Python web framework we've dubbed "Framework in A Box" (fab). Although a new Python web framework has been released every day lately, we figured one more wouldn't hurt. Naturally, ours is far superior to anything else out there.<br /><br />So, being a fab loyalist, I decided to port MrShoe.org to this new and exciting framework. The old MrShoe.org was static and boring (except for the content, that is), so I felt obliged to spice it up a bit now that I have empowered it with fab.<br /><br />The first thing I added was my Blogger blog. This required hacking away most of the pre-fab (pun intended) template that my blog was using and telling Blogger to dump just the data I wanted to MrShoe.org in a reasonable format. Once that was done I went about embedding this data into my site. To most of you mere mortals, I'm sure this sounds like a difficult and dangerous task, but with fab it took no time at all. In fact, I completed the entire port and blog integration in half an afternoon.<br /><br />The hardest part has been writing this blog entry. Maybe I'll start blogging again now that my blog is being broadcast into the living rooms of millions of MrShoe.org visitors every day. I'm not promising anything, though.
