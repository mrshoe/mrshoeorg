	<p><a href="http://www.polimetrix.com/">Polimetrix, Inc.</a> was well represented at <a href="http://us.pycon.org/">PyCon</a> this year. Since MrShoe.org's readership includes both pythonistas and non-pythonistas, I should explain that PyCon is the annual community-organized conference for the <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python programming language</a>. This year <a href="http://www.jamwt.com/">Jamie</a>, <a href="http://www.dowski.com/">Christian</a>, <a href="http://rzoz.blogspot.com/">Ryan</a>, Brad, and I all attended. We had a great time. Here are some highlights.</p><p>Jamie and I gave a talk entitled <a href="http://www.polimetrix.com/pycon/slides/">Scaling Python for High-Load Web Sites</a>. The talk was both well attended and well received. Some <a href="http://www.blueskyonmars.com/2007/03/05/links-for-2007-03-05/">prominent</a> <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2007/Mar/4/">pythonistas</a> have shown their approval. The slides were also posted to <a href="http://programming.reddit.com/info/17u0i/comments">reddit</a> and a number of people <a href="http://del.icio.us/url/ec55e2f66b00e3bf0117ccbe46398579">del.icio.us'd</a> them. We also had some very interesting conversations in the halls with fellow pythonistas who have dealt with some of the problems we covered in the talk. All in all it was a worthwhile experience and I enjoyed it.</p><p>Hanging out in the <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/web-sig/2007-February/002488.html">Web Dudes Pad</a> with <a href="http://www.aminus.org/blogs/index.php/fumanchu">Bob Brewer</a>, <a href="http://tech.whit537.org/">Chad Whitacre</a>, <a href="http://ianbicking.org/">Ian Bicking</a>, and others was a lot of fun. It was great just to meet those guys. Together we reached python enlightenment. I learned that Chad can make just about any conversation entertaining. Bob, I vote the Web Dudes Pad becomes an instant PyCon tradition.</p><p>Some of my favorite talks included <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/ivan/">Ivan Krstic's</a> keynote about the <a href="http://www.laptop.org/">OLPC project</a> and <a href="http://us.pycon.org/zope/talks/2007/sat/track1/061/talkDetails2">Interactive Parallel and Distributed Computing with IPython</a>, by Brian Granger.</p><p>Playing poker at 4am with jamwt and dowski was also fun.</p><p>Here's hoping it's not in Texas (near Dallas) next year</p>
