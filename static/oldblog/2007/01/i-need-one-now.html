	<p>Yesterday I made the trip up to San Francisco to join my friend <a href="http://www.nickmurraymusic.com">Nick Murray</a> and his dad <a href="http://www.unitus.com/sections/aboutus/aboutus_board_mmurray.asp">Mike</a> at <a href="http://www.macworldexpo.com">Macworld Expo</a>. The expo consists of hundreds of booths showcasing third party Mac-related products and one huge central display by Apple itself. Most of the third party products were unremarkable at best: a relatively pedestrian smorgasbord of iPod covers and speakers. Apple, however, managed to make quite the splash.</p><p>Let's not beat around the bush. I have yet to to recover from the prodigious world-rocking meted out by the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> demo. Never before have I witnessed such life changing potential contained within a compact exemplar of consumer electronics masterpiece. In order to emphasize my dire impatience for the iPhone's release I have crafted this crude count down clock.</p><p id="clock"></p><p>I will refine the clock's accuracy when the exact release date is announced.</p>
