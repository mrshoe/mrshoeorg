	<a href="http://www.cbs.com/daytime/price/about/showinfo/">CBS Daytime | The Price Is Right</a>: "Come on down to the longest running game show in television history, now in its 31st season. The show is hosted by Bob Barker, winner of 12 Daytime Emmy awards."<br />That's right, my friends.  We're going to The Price is Right today.  I expect to come home with some new cars...  All I can say is "One dollar, Bob."
