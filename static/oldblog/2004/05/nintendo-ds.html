But capabilities like a touch-screen input, voice recognition and wireless communication set it apart from every other game device, and again demonstrate Nintendoâ€™s passion for groundbreaking originality."<br />We'll see if the DS can compete with the PSP, or if (in the words of Steve) it's just a gimmick.
