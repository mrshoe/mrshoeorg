	Time is flying, MrShoe.org patrons.<br /><br />I planned on dedicating a post to <a href="http://www.python.org/pycon/">PyCon 2006</a>, at which <a href="http://www.polimetrix.com">Polimetrix</a> was represented by three brilliant Pythonistas (myself included). Unfortunately, the excitement of PyCon has all but disappeared around here by now. I do remember that the <a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/news.html">PyPy</a> guys had a lot of cool stuff to say, and that the <a href="http://www.eve-online.com/">Eve Online</a> presentation inspired me to look harder at <a href="http://www.stackless.com">Stackless Python</a> and <a href="http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/greenlet.html">greenlets</a>. I even remember deciding to write a distributed version of <a href="/projects/sol/">Sol</a> in Python using one of these technologies.<br /><br />Alas, none of these plans have seen the light of day due to other contraints on my schedule. What constraints, you ask?<br /><br />Well, <a href="http://www.polimetrix.com">work</a> always takes up way more time than one would like. <a href="http://www.brotherbrown.net">Ryan</a> moved up here to work at <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>, so we've spent a lot of time looking for three-bedroom housing in the Palo Alto area, to no avail. He's on the couch, for now. <a href="http://www.sjsharks.com">The Sharks</a> have kept me busy in front of <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_DisplayProductInformation-Start?CategoryName=tv_ProjectionTVs_RearProjection_42to51TVs&ProductSKU=KDF50E2000&Dept=tvvideo&INT=sstyle-tv_ProjectionTVs-deptfeature-KDF50E2000|sstyle:sy_cat_content_p:tv_projectiontvs">our new TV</a> with their big push going into the playoffs. Unfortunately, I've lost all confidence in them after the last few games. It was a good run, at any rate.<br /><br />I've also been working on a new super-secret project that will be making its way to MrShoe.org soon. I'd tell you about it, but it is super-secret.<br /><br />So I <strong>have</strong> been up to more than just negelcting my web site, albeit not too much more.<br /><br />In other news, <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> just released the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html">MacBook</a> today, which I plan on purchasing very soon. Exciting, no?<br /><br />
